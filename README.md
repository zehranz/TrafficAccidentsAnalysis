# UK Traffic Accident Analysis Project(2000-2016)

## Description

This dataset contains data on more than 1.6 million traffic accidents in the UK for the years 2000-2016. It provides a rich resource for analyzing traffic patterns and accident trends over a significant period.

## Dataset Overview

ukTrafficAADF.csv tracks how much traffic there was on all major roads in the given time period (2000 through 2016). AADT, the core statistic included in this file, stands for "Average Annual Daily Flow", and is a measure of how activity a road segment based on how many vehicle trips traverse it.

Accidents data is split across three CSV files: accidents_2005_to_2007.csv, accidents_2009_to_2011.csv, and accidents_2012_to_2014.csv. These three files together constitute 1.6 million traffic accidents. The total time period is 2005 through 2014, but 2008 is missing.

## Objectives

Using this dataset, we aim to address the following questions:

- **How does changing traffic flow affect accidents?**
- **What factors contribute to an increase in accident rates?**
- **Can we predict accident rates over time?**
- **How have accident patterns differed between rural and urban areas?**
